# library-data
A supplemental library data wiki for Traveller

# Building
The Perl script builds the libdat.json file, which is more or less the "database" of the library data file.

That file is then imported into a fresh/blank TiddlyWiki instance, which builds up the linkages and so forth, then the thing is saved as the new iteration.
