# library-data
A supplemental library data wiki for Traveller

# The "Live" Version
Since September 2019 and at least as of August 2021 lives here: https://traveller5.net/library-data/


# The Original File
The original library data file was built with the included Perl script. It built the libdat.json file, which is more or less the "database" of the library data file. That file was then imported into a fresh/blank TiddlyWiki instance, which built up the linkages and so forth, then the thing was saved as the new iteration.

After the heavy lifting was complete in September 2019, the current version has been hand-edited since.
